# Sorting Algorithms Performance Benchmarker

A C++ application that implements and compares the performance of six different sorting algorithms on large datasets.

## Features
- **6 Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Tests on 15K, 65K, and 150K record datasets
- **Timing Analysis**: Uses C++ Chrono library for precise performance measurement
- **CSV Export**: Results exported for further analysis

## Technology Stack
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- File I/O
- Chrono library for high-resolution timing

## Usage
Compile and run to compare sorting algorithm performance on different dataset sizes.

## Output
Performance metrics showing execution time for each algorithm on each dataset size.
